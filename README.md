# MySensors Weather Station

This Arduino ProMini (3.3V) based project is a [MySensors](https://www.mysensors.org/) solar powered node which reports external temperature, luminosity, humidity, barometric pressure and rain condition. 
It is largely inspired by [this great project](https://forum.mysensors.org/topic/841/solar-powered-mini-weather-station)


## Features

- Temperature using a DS18B20
- Humidity using a DHT22
- Barometric Pressure using a BMP180
- Light Intensity  using a BH1750FVI
- Rain Sensor Module
- Solar + lithium battery powered
